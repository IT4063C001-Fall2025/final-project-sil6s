    "\n",
    "Riders of public transportation and urban planners rely on consistent and trustworthy schedules. However, delays tend to increase during severe weather such as rain, snow, or extreme temperatures. This project examines how weather affects bus and train reliability in major cities. Understanding this relationship can help transit authorities improve scheduling, allocate resources, and communicate delays more effectively."

    "## Approach and Analysis  \n",
    "1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  \n",
    "   - Pull historical transit data (delays, scheduled vs. actual times) via API or CSV.  \n",
    "   - Gather daily/hourly weather data for the same timeframe.  \n",
    "   - Clean and normalize timestamps to ensure alignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Integration**  \n",
    "   - Merge datasets on **date/time** and **location**.  \n",
    "   - Create new variables such as ‚Äúdelay length in minutes‚Äù and ‚Äúweather condition category.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Compute average delay times by weather category (clear, rain, snow, extreme heat/cold).  \n",
    "   - Visualize trends across time of day, day of week, and severity of weather.  \n",
    "   - Run simple correlation/regression analysis to see if precipitation levels or temperature extremes predict delay severity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expected Outcome**  \n",
    "   - Quantifiable evidence that weather significantly increases delay times.  \n",
    "   - Visualizations showing the most impactful conditions.  "
